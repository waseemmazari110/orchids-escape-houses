      <p>Planning a getaway for a large group is both exciting and challenging. Whether you are organising a milestone birthday celebration, a family reunion spanning three generations, or an unforgettable hen weekend, the accommodation you choose sets the tone for the entire trip. In this comprehensive guide, we walk you through every consideration when selecting <a href="/large-group-accommodation">large group accommodation</a> in the UK—from understanding what truly counts as "large group" to avoiding the most common booking pitfalls.</p>

      <h2>What Counts as Large Group Accommodation?</h2>
      <p>In the UK holiday rental market, "large group accommodation" typically refers to properties that can comfortably sleep 10 or more guests. However, this definition varies significantly depending on the type of property and the facilities on offer. A converted barn that technically sleeps 12 might feel cramped compared to a sprawling <a href="/house-styles/manor-houses">manor house</a> designed for 20 guests with multiple lounges and dining areas.</p>
      <p>When browsing listings, look beyond the headline "sleeps" number. Consider the actual bedroom configurations, the number of bathrooms, and—crucially—the communal spaces available. A property that sleeps 16 across eight bedrooms with only one bathroom and a small kitchen is fundamentally different from one with six bathrooms, a professional kitchen, and multiple reception rooms.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Typical Group Sizes: 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30+ Guests</h2>
      <p>Different group sizes present distinct challenges. Here is what to expect at each level:</p>
      <h3>Groups of 10–12</h3>
      <p>This is the sweet spot for many celebrations. You have enough people for a lively atmosphere without the logistical complexity of larger groups. Properties sleeping 10–12 are relatively common, giving you excellent choice across regions from the <a href="/destinations/cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> to <a href="/destinations/brighton">Brighton</a>. Focus on finding a property with at least 4–5 bathrooms and a dining table that seats everyone comfortably.</p>
      <h3>Groups of 15–18</h3>
      <p>At this size, you are entering "large holiday home" territory. Properties become less common, and you will need to book further in advance—especially for peak dates. Look for houses with multiple living areas so the group can split naturally without feeling forced together. A <a href="/features/games-room">games room</a> becomes particularly valuable at this size.</p>
      <h3>Groups of 20–25</h3>
      <p>For groups of 20 or more, you are typically looking at <a href="/house-styles/stately-houses">stately homes</a>, <a href="/house-styles/manor-houses">manor houses</a>, or purpose-built group venues. The dining situation becomes critical—ensure the property explicitly states that everyone can eat together. Kitchen capacity is another concern; look for commercial-grade equipment or multiple kitchens.</p>
      <h3>Groups of 30+</h3>
      <p>At this scale, you may need to consider properties with annexes or multiple buildings on one estate. Alternatively, some groups split across two neighbouring properties. For celebrations like weddings, this can actually work beautifully—one house for the wedding party, another for family. Check with property owners about their policy on combining bookings.</p>

      <h2>Houses vs Hotels for Large Groups</h2>
      <p>The hotel-versus-house debate is one of the first decisions you will face. While hotels offer convenience and on-site staff, they rarely provide the communal experience that makes group getaways special. In a hotel, your group is fragmented across corridors and floors, meeting only at scheduled mealtimes in the restaurant.</p>
      <p>A <a href="/large-holiday-houses">large holiday house</a> transforms the dynamic entirely. The entire property is exclusively yours. You can gather in the lounge at midnight, enjoy breakfast in your pyjamas at noon, and create shared memories in every room. For groups celebrating a special occasion, this privacy and togetherness is invaluable. View our <a href="/properties/brighton-manor">Brighton Manor</a> or <a href="/properties/bath-spa-retreat">Bath Spa Retreat</a> to see what is possible.</p>

      <h2>Facilities to Prioritise</h2>
      <p>Not all facilities are created equal when it comes to group stays. Here are the ones that consistently deliver the most value:</p>
      <h3>Hot Tubs</h3>
      <p>A <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs">house with a hot tub</a> is almost universally popular. It provides a natural gathering point, particularly in the evenings. For larger groups, check the hot tub capacity—some are designed for 4 people, others for 8 or more. Be aware of any usage restrictions (many properties prohibit hot tub use after 10pm to respect neighbours).</p>
      <h3>Games Rooms</h3>
      <p>A dedicated <a href="/features/games-room">games room</a> gives your group a space for entertainment without disturbing those who want to relax in the main lounge. Look for properties with pool tables, table tennis, darts, and arcade machines. Some properties also have <a href="/features/cinema-room">cinema rooms</a>—perfect for rainy afternoons or late-night film marathons.</p>
      <h3>Large Dining Areas</h3>
      <p>The ability to dine together is often the most cherished aspect of a group stay. Verify that the dining table genuinely seats your entire party. Some listings state "sleeps 20" but only have dining for 14. Check photos carefully, and do not hesitate to message the owner for confirmation.</p>
      <h3>Outdoor Spaces</h3>
      <p>For summer gatherings, gardens, terraces, and BBQ areas extend your living space significantly. Look for enclosed gardens if children are in the group, and check whether the property has outdoor furniture for the full party.</p>

      <h2>Location Considerations for Group Weekends</h2>
      <p>The ideal location depends on your group's priorities. Consider these factors:</p>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>If guests are travelling from across the UK, a central location like the <a href="/destinations/peak-district">Peak District</a> or <a href="/destinations/cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> minimises everyone's journey time. For groups relying on public transport, properties near <a href="/destinations/bath">Bath</a>, <a href="/destinations/brighton">Brighton</a>, or <a href="/destinations/york">York</a> train stations offer convenience.</p>
      <h3>Activities and Nightlife</h3>
      <p>What does your group want to do beyond the property? Activity-focused groups might prefer the <a href="/destinations/lake-district">Lake District</a> for hiking or <a href="/destinations/cornwall">Cornwall</a> for surfing. Those seeking nightlife and restaurants will enjoy <a href="/destinations/manchester">Manchester</a> or Brighton.</p>
      <h3>Isolation vs Proximity</h3>
      <p>Remote rural properties offer peace and privacy but require more planning for supplies and activities. Properties near villages or towns provide easier access to pubs, shops, and local attractions. Consider your group's preferences—some love the seclusion of a countryside estate, others feel isolated without nearby amenities.</p>

      <h2>Noise, Neighbours, and Local Rules</h2>
      <p>Large groups naturally generate more noise and activity than a couple on a quiet retreat. Being a considerate guest is both ethically important and practically essential—noise complaints can result in early termination of your stay.</p>
      <p>Most properties have "quiet hours" (typically 10pm–8am) when outdoor activities and loud music must cease. Properties with <a href="/features/hot-tub">hot tubs</a> often have earlier cut-off times for outdoor use. Before booking, check the house rules carefully. If your group is celebrating a hen party or 40th birthday, be honest with the owner about your intentions—they may suggest a more suitable property or confirm that yours is appropriate for livelier celebrations.</p>
      <p>Rural properties with no immediate neighbours offer more flexibility, but even then, sound travels further than you might expect on quiet nights. Be mindful, and your host—and future groups—will thank you.</p>

      <h2>Booking Directly with Property Owners: Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p>When booking large group accommodation, you will encounter a mix of agency listings and direct owner rentals. Each approach has advantages:</p>
      <h3>Direct Booking Benefits</h3>
      <p>Booking directly often means lower prices (no platform fees), more flexibility on terms, and a direct line to someone who knows the property intimately. Owners can answer specific questions about bedroom layouts, nearby attractions, and suitability for your particular group.</p>
      <h3>Agency and Platform Benefits</h3>
      <p>Platforms like Escape Houses provide standardised booking processes, verified reviews, and customer support if issues arise. For first-time group organisers, this peace of mind can be valuable.</p>
      <p>Whichever route you choose, ensure you receive a clear booking confirmation detailing the property address, total cost breakdown, deposit requirements, and cancellation policy.</p>

      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <p>After years of helping groups find the perfect property, we have identified the most frequent errors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Booking based on "sleeps" alone:</strong> Always verify bathroom ratios, dining capacity, and living space.</li>
        <li><strong>Underestimating kitchen needs:</strong> Cooking for 20 requires commercial-scale equipment. Check for multiple ovens, large fridge-freezers, and sufficient crockery.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring parking:</strong> 15 guests might mean 8 cars. Ensure adequate parking exists—particularly important at rural properties with narrow access roads.</li>
        <li><strong>Not reading the fine print:</strong> Security deposits, cleaning fees, and minimum night stays vary significantly. Factor all costs into your comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaving booking too late:</strong> Premium properties for 20+ guests are limited. For Christmas, New Year, or summer weekends, book 12–18 months ahead.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Choosing the right large group accommodation is about matching your specific needs—group size, celebration type, activity preferences, and budget—to the right property. Take time to research thoroughly, ask questions, and book with confidence.</p>
      <p>Ready to start your search? Explore our <a href="/large-group-accommodation">large group accommodation</a> collection to find properties across the UK that cater specifically to groups of 10, 15, 20, or 30+ guests.

      <p>When organising a group weekend—whether for a hen party, milestone birthday, family reunion, or friends' getaway—one of the first major decisions is where to stay. Should you book a block of hotel rooms or rent a <a href="/large-holiday-houses">large holiday house</a>? Both options have their merits, but for most group celebrations, a private house delivers an experience that hotels simply cannot match.</p>
      <p>In this guide, we examine both options honestly, helping you make the right choice for your specific group and occasion.</p>

      <h2>When a Hotel Makes Sense</h2>
      <p>Before we advocate for holiday houses, let us acknowledge the scenarios where hotels genuinely work better:</p>
      <h3>Business Trips and Conferences</h3>
      <p>If your group needs meeting rooms, AV equipment, and professional catering for a corporate event, purpose-built conference hotels are designed for this. A country house might feel inappropriate for quarterly sales meetings.</p>
      <h3>Very Short Stays (One Night)</h3>
      <p>For a single night—perhaps before an early flight or after a concert—a hotel near the venue offers simplicity. You arrive late, sleep, and leave. The communal benefits of a house require at least two nights to materialise.</p>
      <h3>Groups Who Prefer Independence</h3>
      <p>Some groups prefer the structure of hotel life: everyone has their own room, meals are provided, and there is no communal cooking or cleaning. If your group values personal space over shared experiences, hotels accommodate this.</p>
      <h3>Urban Centres Without House Options</h3>
      <p>In dense city centres like central London, large houses for groups are rare and expensive. A boutique hotel might be the practical choice if you want to be steps from attractions.</p>

      <h2>When a Large Group House is Better</h2>
      <p>For the majority of group celebrations, a private house wins decisively. Here is why:</p>
      <h3>Exclusive Use and Privacy</h3>
      <p>When you book a <a href="/house-styles/manor-houses">manor house</a> or <a href="/house-styles/luxury-houses">luxury holiday home</a>, the entire property is yours. No sharing the lounge with strangers, no awkward elevator encounters, no noise complaints from neighbouring rooms. Your group can socialise freely, play music, stay up late talking, and create memories without interruption.</p>
      <h3>Communal Spaces That Actually Work</h3>
      <p>Hotels are designed for sleeping, not socialising. Finding a corner of a hotel lobby that fits 15 people is nearly impossible. A large holiday house is the opposite—it is built around communal living. Grand lounges, expansive kitchens, dining rooms with 20-seat tables, and outdoor terraces provide multiple spaces for the group to gather or split naturally.</p>
      <h3>The "Home" Experience</h3>
      <p>There is something special about a group cooking together, sharing bottles of wine in the garden, or having breakfast in pyjamas at noon. This domestic intimacy creates bonding opportunities that hotel stays rarely offer.</p>

      <h2>Cost Comparison for Groups of 10–30</h2>
      <p>The assumption that hotels are cheaper than houses is often wrong. Let us break down the numbers:</p>
      <h3>Hotel Scenario: 15 Guests in Bath</h3>
      <p>A mid-range hotel in <a href="/destinations/bath">Bath</a> charges approximately £150 per room per night. For 15 guests (requiring 8 rooms, assuming some sharing), that is £1,200 per night. A two-night weekend totals £2,400 before breakfast, dinner, or drinks in the hotel bar. Add three restaurant meals for 15 people at £40 per head, and catering alone reaches £1,800. Total weekend cost: approximately £4,200+.</p>
      <h3>Holiday House Scenario: 15 Guests in Bath</h3>
      <p>A luxury house sleeping 16 in Bath might cost £3,000 for a weekend (Friday–Sunday). Self-catering breakfast and one big home-cooked dinner saves dramatically on food costs. Even adding a <a href="/holiday-focus/book-private-chef">private chef</a> for one evening (approximately £600) brings the total to around £3,600—and you have far superior facilities, privacy, and flexibility.</p>
      <h3>The Per-Person Calculation</h3>
      <p>When you divide house rental by guest numbers, the value becomes even clearer. A £5,000 manor house for 25 guests is £200 per person for the entire weekend—often less than a single hotel night per person.</p>

      <h2>Privacy and Shared Spaces</h2>
      <p>One of the most significant differences lies in how space functions:</p>
      <h3>Hotel Fragmentation</h3>
      <p>In a hotel, your group is scattered across corridors and floors. You might not see half your party between dinner and breakfast. Coordinating activities requires WhatsApp groups and text chains. The default setting is "apart," with effort required to be "together."</p>
      <h3>House Integration</h3>
      <p>A holiday house inverts this dynamic. The default is togetherness—people naturally gather in the kitchen for coffee, drift into the lounge for conversation, or meet at the <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs">hot tub</a> after dinner. Quiet moments alone require seeking out a bedroom or garden corner, but the communal atmosphere remains.</p>
      <p>For celebrations that are fundamentally about connection—hen parties, reunion weekends, birthday gatherings—this architectural difference profoundly shapes the experience.</p>

      <h2>Catering and Self-Catering Options</h2>
      <p>Food is a major consideration for any group weekend:</p>
      <h3>Hotel Catering</h3>
      <p>Hotels offer convenience: breakfast is served, room service is available, and restaurants are on-site. However, this comes at hotel prices, limited menu choices, and often the inability to accommodate large group bookings at a single table.</p>
      <h3>Self-Catering Freedom</h3>
      <p>In a holiday house, the kitchen is yours. This opens multiple options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full self-catering:</strong> Guests share cooking duties, creating meals together. This works wonderfully for foodie groups who enjoy collaborative cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> Breakfast and lunch are self-catered, with one or two dinners out at local restaurants.</li>
        <li><strong>Private chef:</strong> For special occasions, hire a chef to prepare a multi-course dinner in the house. This provides restaurant-quality food with the intimacy of dining at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery and takeaway:</strong> Many areas offer excellent local delivery options, from pizza to Indian cuisine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Properties with professional-grade kitchens—double ovens, commercial dishwashers, large preparation spaces—make catering for 20+ guests genuinely feasible.</p>

      <h2>Flexibility for Celebrations</h2>
      <p>Hotels operate on fixed schedules: breakfast ends at 10am, check-out is at 11am, the bar closes at midnight. Your celebration must fit their timetable.</p>
      <p>A private house offers complete flexibility:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brunch at 1pm? No problem.</li>
        <li>Want to set up a surprise birthday breakfast before the guest of honour wakes? Done.</li>
        <li>Planning <a href="/spa-treatments">spa treatments</a> in the afternoon? Arrange them at the house.</li>
        <li>Late-night conversations that run until 3am? The lounge is yours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This flexibility is particularly valuable for hen parties, where activities like <a href="/experiences">cocktail making classes</a>, afternoon tea, or pamper sessions can happen at the property rather than requiring transport to external venues.</p>

      <h2>Weekend Itinerary Examples</h2>
      <p>To illustrate the difference, here are two contrasting weekend schedules:</p>
      <h3>Hotel Weekend (15 Guests, Brighton)</h3>
      <p><strong>Friday:</strong> Arrive individually, meet in hotel bar. Dinner at restaurant (struggled to find one seating 15 together). Back to hotel bar, early night as bar closes at midnight.</p>
      <p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Breakfast in shifts (restaurant seats 8 max). Day activities in town. Afternoon tea at external venue. Dinner at another restaurant. Night out in Brighton.</p>
      <p><strong>Sunday:</strong> Rush to vacate rooms by 11am. Awkward goodbye in hotel reception. Head home.</p>
      <h3>Holiday House Weekend (15 Guests, Brighton)</h3>
      <p><strong>Friday:</strong> Arrive and explore the house. Unpack and settle into rooms. Welcome drinks on the terrace overlooking the sea. Catered welcome dinner at the house (private chef). Games room tournament until late. Hot tub under the stars.</p>
      <p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Leisurely breakfast together at the big dining table. Walk along <a href="/destinations/brighton">Brighton</a> seafront. Return for a pamper session arranged at the house. Cocktail making class in the kitchen. Group dinner cooked together. Late-night dancing in the lounge.</p>
      <p><strong>Sunday:</strong> Final breakfast. Photos in the garden. Relaxed check-out at 10am with time for proper goodbyes.</p>
      <p>The house weekend is richer, more connected, and—usually—cheaper.</p>

      <h2>Realistic Expectations for Group Stays</h2>
      <p>While we firmly believe holiday houses offer superior group experiences, it is important to set realistic expectations:</p>
      <h3>You Will Not Have Hotel Service</h3>
      <p>There is no concierge, no room service at 2am, no housekeeping during your stay. If you want towels changed daily or beds made, a house is not replicating that hotel luxury.</p>
      <h3>Self-Organisation is Required</h3>
      <p>Someone needs to coordinate shopping, cooking rotas (if self-catering), and cleaning up. This is part of the communal experience, but it does require willing participants.</p>
      <h3>Properties Vary in Quality</h3>
      <p>Not all holiday houses are equal. Read reviews carefully, examine photos thoroughly, and book through reputable platforms like Escape Houses that vet properties for quality.</p>

      <h2>Making Your Decision</h2>
      <p>Choose a hotel if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your stay is one night or less</li>
        <li>You need professional conference facilities</li>
        <li>The group prefers independent schedules and personal space</li>
        <li>No suitable houses exist in your target area</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choose a holiday house if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connection and celebration are central to your weekend</li>
        <li>You want exclusive, private space for your group</li>
        <li>Flexibility with schedules and activities matters</li>
        <li>Value for money is a consideration</li>
        <li>Facilities like <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs">hot tubs</a>, <a href="/features/games-room">games rooms</a>, and large gardens appeal</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The United Kingdom offers an extraordinary diversity of landscapes, cities, and experiences—making it ideal for <a href="/large-group-accommodation">large group weekends</a>. Whether your party craves coastal energy, countryside tranquillity, urban nightlife, or historic charm, there is a destination perfectly suited to your celebration.</p>
      <p>In this comprehensive guide, we explore the best UK destinations for groups of 10, 15, 20, or more guests, highlighting why each location works, what property types to expect, the activities on offer, and practical travel considerations.</p>

      <h2>Brighton: The Classic Party Destination</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p><a href="/destinations/brighton">Brighton</a> has earned its reputation as the UK's premier party destination for good reason. The city combines beautiful beaches, a vibrant LGBTQ+ friendly atmosphere, exceptional nightlife, and a creative, anything-goes spirit that makes celebrations feel special.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>Brighton offers stunning Regency townhouses and seafront villas, many sleeping 12–20 guests. Expect grand period features—high ceilings, bay windows, and elegant proportions—combined with modern updates including <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs">hot tubs</a> and contemporary kitchens. Our <a href="/properties/brighton-manor">Brighton Manor</a> and <a href="/properties/brighton-seafront-villa">Brighton Seafront Villa</a> exemplify the best of Brighton accommodation.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>
      <p>Brighton excels at group activities: beach walks along the iconic pier, cocktail bars in The Lanes, club nights in Kemptown, daytime spas, and Brighton Pavilion visits. The city is compact enough that everything is walkable—no taxis required.</p>
      <h3>Travel and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Brighton is just one hour from London Victoria by train, with regular services throughout the day. For groups arriving by car, seafront parking can be challenging—book properties with off-street parking where possible.</p>

      <h2>London: Urban Sophistication at Scale</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p><a href="/destinations/london">London</a> needs little introduction. The capital offers world-class restaurants, West End shows, historic landmarks, and nightlife ranging from exclusive cocktail bars to legendary clubs. For groups wanting urban energy and endless activity options, London delivers.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>Large group properties in London are rarer and pricier than elsewhere, but they exist. Expect elegant Georgian townhouses in zones 1–2, or larger properties in leafy suburbs like Hampstead or Richmond. Most London group houses sleep 10–14 guests.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>
      <p>The options are limitless: West End musicals, private dining experiences, river cruises, Borough Market food tours, afternoon tea at iconic hotels, and club nights from Shoreditch to Mayfair. London caters to every taste and budget.</p>
      <h3>Travel and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>London is the UK's transport hub—accessible from anywhere by train, plane, or road. Within the city, the Tube makes getting around easy. For groups, consider properties near stations to minimise logistics.</p>

      <h2>Cornwall: Coastal Magic</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p><a href="/destinations/cornwall">Cornwall</a> offers dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, world-class surfing, and a relaxed pace that feels like escaping to another world. For groups seeking nature, adventure, and that unmistakable coastal atmosphere, Cornwall is unbeatable.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>Cornwall specialises in converted farmhouses, coastal estates, and properties with <a href="/features/direct-beach-access">direct beach access</a>. Larger properties sleeping 15–25 guests are available, often featuring gardens, terraces overlooking the sea, and <a href="/features/swimming-pool">swimming pools</a> for warmer months.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>
      <p>Surfing lessons at Newquay, coasteering adventures, beach barbecues, visits to the Eden Project, cliff walks along the South West Coast Path, and evenings at harbour-front pubs. Cornwall rewards active, outdoorsy groups.</p>
      <h3>Travel and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Cornwall requires commitment to reach—it is 4–5 hours by car from London, or a scenic train journey via the Riviera Line. Once there, a car (or cars) is essential for exploring the peninsula's scattered attractions.</p>

      <h2>Lake District: Mountain Majesty</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p>The <a href="/destinations/lake-district">Lake District</a> provides the UK's most dramatic mountain scenery: glacial lakes, rugged fells, and charming stone villages. For groups who want to hike, explore, and return to a cosy property with roaring fires, the Lakes deliver an unforgettable experience.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>Expect traditional lakeland architecture—stone-built houses, <a href="/house-styles/large-cottages">large cottages</a>, and converted barns. Many properties feature incredible views, open fires, and <a href="/features/hot-tub">hot tubs</a> perfect for post-hike relaxation. Properties sleeping 12–20 guests are available across the region.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>

      <h2>Cotswolds: Quintessential England</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p>The <a href="/destinations/cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> represents the English countryside ideal: honey-coloured stone villages, rolling hills, country pubs, and an unhurried pace of life. For groups seeking relaxation, gastronomy, and picture-postcard scenery, the Cotswolds excels.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>The Cotswolds specialises in <a href="/house-styles/manor-houses">manor houses</a>, <a href="/house-styles/country-houses">country houses</a>, and converted farm estates. Properties here tend to be grand—sweeping lawns, walled gardens, formal dining rooms, and extensive grounds. Houses sleeping 20–30 guests are more common here than almost anywhere else in the UK.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>
      <p>Village walking tours (Bourton-on-the-Water, Bibury, Broadway), vineyard visits, cooking classes, spa days, antique shopping, and extended lunches at Michelin-starred restaurants. The Cotswolds suits groups who value quality over adrenaline.</p>
      <h3>Travel and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>The Cotswolds is ideally positioned—about 90 minutes from London, Birmingham, and Bristol. However, public transport is limited; car travel is strongly recommended for exploring the region's dispersed attractions.</p>

      <h2>Manchester: Northern Powerhouse</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p><a href="/destinations/manchester">Manchester</a> offers a compelling mix of cultural attractions, legendary music heritage, excellent dining, and some of the UK's best nightlife. For groups seeking urban energy without London prices, Manchester delivers outstanding value.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>Manchester city centre features converted warehouse apartments and townhouses, while suburbs like Didsbury offer larger properties with gardens. The <a href="/properties/manchester-party-house">Manchester Party House</a> showcases the contemporary style available in this vibrant city.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>
      <p>Football stadium tours (Old Trafford or Etihad), Northern Quarter bar crawls, MediaCity visits, canal-side dining, live music venues, and clubs that stay open until 4am. Manchester excels at high-energy group weekends.</p>

      <h2>Devon: Coastal Charm and Countryside</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p><a href="/destinations/devon">Devon</a> offers the best of both worlds: stunning coastline along the English Riviera and Jurassic Coast, plus rolling farmland, moorland (Dartmoor), and charming market towns. It is slightly more accessible than Cornwall while offering similar natural beauty.</p>
      <h3>Typical Property Types</h3>
      <p>Devon features converted barns, coastal villas with sea views, and <a href="/house-styles/country-houses">country estates</a>. Properties with <a href="/features/swimming-pool">swimming pools</a> and extensive gardens are common, particularly in South Devon.</p>
      <h3>Activities Suited to Groups</h3>
      <p>Beach days at Woolacombe or Croyde, cream teas in Dartmouth, Dartmoor hiking, surf lessons, coastal walks, and exploring historic Exeter. Devon suits groups seeking a mix of relaxation and gentle activity.</p>
      <h3>Travel and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Devon is 3–4 hours from London by car, with train services to Exeter and Torquay. A car is recommended for reaching coastal properties and exploring the county.</p>

      <h2>York: Historic Splendour</h2>
      <h3>Why It Works for Groups</h3>
      <p><a href="/destinations/york">York</a> delivers history, charm, and excellent dining within a compact, walkable city. The medieval streets, York Minster, and atmospheric pubs create a unique setting for group celebrations—particularly those seeking culture alongside socialising.</p>

    title: "What to Check When Booking Accommodation for 20+ Guests",
    date: "Dec 24, 2025",
    category: "Checklist",

      <p>Organising a trip for 20 or more people is a logistical feat. The stakes are high, and the details matter. When booking <a href="/large-group-accommodation">accommodation for 20+ guests</a>, a standard holiday rental simply won't cut it. You need a property built for scale. Here is our essential checklist to ensure your massive group booking goes off without a hitch.</p>

      <h2>1. Bedroom Configurations and Flexibility</h2>
      <p>When you have 20+ guests, the sleeping arrangements are complex. Don't just count the number of bedrooms; look at the bed configurations. Are there 'zip and link' beds that can be converted from twins to doubles? This flexibility is crucial for groups with a mix of couples and singles. Check if any rooms are interconnecting—perfect for families with young children—and ensure there are enough bathrooms to avoid a morning logjam.</p>

      <h2>2. The Dining Table Challenge</h2>
      <p>One of the most common oversights is the dining table. A house might sleep 22, but does the dining table actually sit 22 people in one go? For many groups, the shared meals are the highlight of the trip. Ensure the property description explicitly mentions that everyone can dine together. Look for <a href="/house-styles/stately-houses">stately homes</a> or <a href="/house-styles/manor-houses">manor houses</a> which usually feature grand formal dining rooms.</p>

      <h2>3. Kitchen Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>Cooking for 20 people requires more than just a standard oven. Look for kitchens with 'double everything': two dishwashers, two large fridge-freezers, and multiple ovens. If you are hiring a <a href="/holiday-focus/book-private-chef">private chef</a>, they will appreciate a professional-grade setup. Check if there is enough crockery, glassware, and oversized pots and pans to cater for a small army.</p>

      <h2>4. Parking and Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Twenty guests often mean five to ten cars. Ensure the property has sufficient off-road parking. If you are booking a central townhouse in <a href="/destinations/bath">Bath</a>, parking might be restricted, so check for nearby public car parks or provided permits. For rural properties, ensure the access roads are suitable for larger vehicles or multiple cars arriving at once.</p>

      <h2>5. Activities for All Ages</h2>
      <p>With a group this size, interests will vary. A <a href="/features/games-room">house with a games room</a>, a <a href="/features/swimming-pool">swimming pool</a>, or a <a href="/features/tennis-court">tennis court</a> provides essential entertainment that keeps everyone occupied without having to leave the property. Large gardens are also a major plus for summer gatherings.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>What happens if our group size changes?</h3>
      <p>It is always easier to scale down slightly than to add guests to a property at capacity. We recommend booking a property that has a little 'breathing room'—for example, booking a 24-sleeper for 20 guests.</p>
      <h3>Do we need to bring our own towels?</h3>
      <p>At Escape Houses, our <a href="/properties">luxury properties</a> typically include all linens and towels, but it's always worth double-checking the specific property listing for details.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Booking for 20+ guests requires a keen eye for detail. By focusing on dining capacity, bedroom flexibility, and kitchen infrastructure, you can ensure a comfortable and stress-free stay for everyone. Explore our <a href="/large-group-accommodation">large houses for 20+ guests</a> today.</p>

    title: "Noise Rules and Neighbour Considerations for Group Stays",
    date: "Dec 23, 2025",
    category: "Rules",
    image: "https://slelguoygbfzlpylpxfs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/project-uploads/8330e9be-5e47-4f2b-bda0-4162d899b6d9/generated_images/professional-stock-photo-of-hen-party-ac-2ed8f30b-20251018105832.jpg",

      <p>We want every group that stays with Escape Houses to have a fantastic, celebratory time. However, when 15 or 20 people get together, noise levels can naturally escalate. To ensure the long-term sustainability of <a href="/large-group-accommodation">large group accommodation</a> in local communities, it is vital to be a respectful guest. This guide explains how to enjoy your stay while maintaining a good relationship with the neighbours.</p>

      <h2>1. Understanding Local Regulations</h2>
      <p>Many councils in popular destinations like the <a href="/destinations/cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> or <a href="/destinations/brighton">Brighton</a> have strict 'quiet hours'—usually between 10 PM and 8 AM. These aren't just suggestions; they are often part of the property's licensing agreement. Respecting these hours ensures that your host doesn't face complaints or fines, and that future guests can continue to enjoy the property.</p>

      <h2>2. Hot Tubs and Outdoor Spaces</h2>
      <p>Outdoor noise travels surprisingly far, especially in quiet rural areas. If you have booked a <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs">house with a hot tub</a>, please be aware that many properties have a strict 'no hot tub use after 10 PM' policy. Sound bounces off water and walls, meaning a conversation that feels quiet to you can be heard clearly in a neighbouring bedroom.</p>

      <h2>3. Music and Entertainment</h2>
      <p>While a <a href="/house-styles/party-houses">party house</a> is built for fun, this usually applies to the inside of the property. Keep music indoors after dark and ensure windows and doors are closed if you are playing music at a higher volume. Many properties now use noise-monitoring technology (which doesn't record conversations but monitors decibel levels) to alert guests if they are getting too loud.</p>

      <h2>4. Arrival and Departure</h2>
      <p>Noise isn't just about music; it's about the logistics of a large group. Try to arrive in as few cars as possible and be mindful of slamming car doors or loud shouting when arriving late at night or leaving early in the morning. Being a 'good neighbour' starts the moment you pull into the driveway.</p>

      <h2>5. Communication with Your Host</h2>
      <p>If you are planning an event—such as a cocktail masterclass or a celebratory dinner—let your host know in advance. They can often provide specific advice on how to manage the group's impact on the immediate area.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>Can we have a DJ?</h3>
      <p>Most residential holiday homes do not permit external DJs or amplified PA systems. However, many of our <a href="/properties">luxury houses</a> have high-quality built-in sound systems that are perfect for a celebratory atmosphere within reasonable limits.</p>
      <h3>What happens if a neighbour complains?</h3>
      <p>Neighbour complaints are taken seriously. Usually, a host will contact you to ask you to lower the volume. Consistent noise disturbances can, in extreme cases, result in the termination of your stay without a refund, as outlined in our <a href="/terms">booking terms</a>.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Respectful celebration is the key to a successful group holiday. By following a few simple rules, you can have an incredible time without impacting the local community. Enjoy your stay and thank you for being a considerate guest.</p>
