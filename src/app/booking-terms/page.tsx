                    Group Escape Houses provides an advertising service for property owners to list their group accommodation. We are not a booking agent, travel agent or property management company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When you submit an enquiry through our platform, your details are sent directly to the property owner. All subsequent communications, booking confirmations, payment arrangements and contractual agreements are made directly between you and the property owner.

                    Group Escape Houses does not handle booking payments, deposits or security deposits. We do not set the final rental price or determine availability.

                    <strong>Deposits and Balances:</strong> Payments, deposits and booking terms are agreed and handled directly with the property owner. Most owners will require a deposit to secure your dates, followed by a final balance payment.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Security Deposits:</strong> Most owners require a refundable security deposit to cover potential damage. These are managed and held directly by the property owner, not by Group Escape Houses.
