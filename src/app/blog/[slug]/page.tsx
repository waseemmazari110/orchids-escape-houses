      <p>Planning a <a href="/hen-party-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hen party</a> and tired of the same old spa day suggestions? You're not alone. While there's nothing wrong with a relaxing <a href="/spa-treatments" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">spa treatment</a>, today's hen parties are all about creating unique memories that reflect the bride's personality.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Cocktail Making Masterclass</h2>
      <p>Learn to shake, stir, and muddle like a pro. A <a href="/experiences/cocktail-masterclass" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">cocktail making class</a> is interactive, fun, and gives everyone new skills to show off at future parties. Plus, you get to drink your creations. Available at most of our <a href="/properties" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hen party houses</a>, this activity works brilliantly in <a href="/destinations/brighton" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Brighton</a> or <a href="/destinations/bath" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Bath</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Life Drawing with a Twist</h2>
      <p>Whether it's a professional model or one of the classic '<a href="/experiences/life-drawing" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">butler in the buff</a>' sessions, life drawing adds a cheeky edge to your hen party. It's surprisingly relaxing and guaranteed to create some hilarious moments. This is one of our most popular <a href="/experiences" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hen party experiences</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Dance Workshop</h2>
      <p>From burlesque to street dance, learning a routine together is a brilliant bonding experience. Many instructors can even choreograph something special for the bride. Check our <a href="/experiences" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">experiences page</a> for available dance workshops in your chosen destination.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Private Chef Experience</h2>
      <p>Why go out when you can bring a Michelin-trained chef to your <a href="/house-styles/luxury-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">holiday house</a>?

Our <a href="/experiences/private-chef" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">private chef service</a> is perfect for groups who want to enjoy fine dining in the comfort of their own space.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Outdoor Adventures</h2>
      <p>For the active bride, consider coasteering, paddleboarding, or even a wild swimming session followed by hot chocolate and cake. Our properties in <a href="/destinations/bournemouth" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="/destinations/cornwall" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Cornwall</a> are perfect for outdoor activities.</p>

      <h2>8. Glamping Experience</h2>
      <p>Luxury camping with proper beds, <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hot tubs</a>, and fire pits.

Many of our <a href="/properties" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">group houses</a> can arrange art workshops.</p>
      
      <h2>10. Murder Mystery Evening</h2>

      <p>Brighton has earned its reputation as the UK's <a href="/hen-party-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hen party capital</a>, and for good reason. This vibrant seaside city combines beach vibes with city energy, quirky independent shops with high-end boutiques, and a nightlife scene that caters to every taste.</p>
      
      <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
      <p>Brighton and the surrounding areas offer some of the <a href="/destinations/brighton" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">best hen party houses in the UK</a>. Look for <a href="/properties" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">properties</a> in Hove for a quieter vibe, or stay central in Brighton for easy access to everything. Must-have features include <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hot tubs</a>, spacious living areas, and walking distance to the seafront. Our <a href="/house-styles/luxury-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">luxury houses</a> in Brighton sleep 12-20 guests comfortably.</p>
      
      <h2>Brunch Spots</h2>
      <p><strong>The Ivy in the Lanes</strong> - Classic and elegant, perfect for a civilised start to the day.</p>
      <p><strong>Pompoko</strong> - Quick, affordable Japanese food that's become a Brighton institution.</p>
      <p><strong>Mange Tout</strong> - Cosy cafe with excellent vegetarian options and the best coffee in town.</p>
      
      <h2>Afternoon Activities</h2>
      <p>Explore the famous Lanes for vintage shopping and independent boutiques. Walk the pier for classic seaside fun. Book a <a href="/experiences/cocktail-masterclass" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">cocktail making class</a> or <a href="/experiences/life-drawing" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">life drawing session</a> at one of the many venues that specialise in hen parties. Check out our <a href="/blog/alternative-hen-party-ideas" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">10 alternative hen party ideas</a> for more inspiration.</p>
      
      <h2>Dinner Destinations</h2>
      <p><strong>The Coal Shed</strong> - Upscale steakhouse perfect for a celebration meal.</p>
      <p><strong>Terre à Terre</strong> - Renowned vegetarian restaurant that even meat-eaters rave about.</p>
      <p><strong>The Salt Room</strong> - Seafood restaurant with stunning views of the pier.</p>
      <p>Can't decide where to go? Consider booking a <a href="/experiences/private-chef" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">private chef</a> to cook at your <a href="/house-styles/party-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">party house</a> instead.</p>
      
      <h2>Nightlife</h2>
      <p>Brighton's nightlife is legendary. Start with cocktails at The Plotting Parlour or Bohemia. Move on to Patterns for dancing, or Revolution for a livelier crowd. End the night at Pryzm or Coalition for proper club vibes.</p>
      
      <h2>Sunday Recovery</h2>
      <p>Head to Hove for a gentler Sunday. Walk along the seafront, grab fish and chips, and maybe brave a dip in the sea if you're feeling adventurous. The Urchin pub does an excellent roast dinner. Return to your house with a <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hot tub</a> for the ultimate recovery session.</p>
      
      <h2>Top Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Book restaurants in advance, especially for large groups</li>
        <li>The weather can be unpredictable - pack layers</li>
        <li>Walking is the best way to get around, but Ubers are plentiful</li>
        <li>Brighton Pride is in August - avoid that weekend unless you want to join the party</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Brighton is the perfect hen party destination because it genuinely has something for everyone.

    title: "How to Split Costs Fairly on a Hen Weekend",
    excerpt: "Money can be awkward, but it doesn't have to be. Our practical tips for managing group expenses, deposits, and add-ons without the drama.",
    category: "Planning Tips",
    image: "https://slelguoygbfzlpylpxfs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/project-uploads/8330e9be-5e47-4f2b-bda0-4162d899b6d9/generated_images/professional-stock-photo-showing-split-c-189baecf-20251018105904.jpg",

    content: `
      <p>Let's talk about the most awkward part of planning a <a href="/hen-party-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hen party</a>: money. Getting the finances right can make or break the weekend, but with clear communication and fair systems, it doesn't have to be stressful. This guide complements our <a href="/blog/hen-party-checklist" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">complete planning checklist</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Set a Budget Early</h2>
      <p>Before <a href="/properties" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">booking anything</a>, poll the group. What's everyone comfortable spending? Be honest about the fact that hen parties aren't cheap, but also make sure no one feels pressured to go beyond their means. Check our <a href="/how-it-works" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">booking guide</a> to understand typical costs.</p>
      
      <h2>The Bride Shouldn't Pay</h2>
      <p>This is standard practice. Split the bride's share between the other guests. If there are 10 people total, each guest pays 1/9th of the total costs, not 1/10th.</p>
      
      <h2>Break Down the Costs</h2>
      <p>Be transparent from the start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accommodation</strong> - Usually the biggest expense. Our <a href="/house-styles/luxury-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">luxury houses</a> range from £2,000-£5,000 for a weekend.</li>
        <li><strong>Activities</strong> - <a href="/experiences/cocktail-masterclass" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Cocktail classes</a>, <a href="/experiences/life-drawing" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">life drawing</a>, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Group meals</strong> - Dinner, brunch, or a <a href="/experiences/private-chef" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">private chef</a></li>
        <li><strong>Decorations and supplies</strong> - Balloons, sashes, games</li>
        <li><strong>Shared transport</strong> - If hiring a minibuss</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Use Money Management Apps</h2>
      <p>Apps like Splitwise or Monzo's group tabs make tracking expenses much easier. Everyone can see what's been paid and what they owe in real time.</p>
      
      <h2>Deposit Strategy</h2>
      <p>Collect deposits early – ideally 50% when booking and the balance 6-8 weeks before the event. This gives people time to budget rather than hitting them with a large bill all at once. Learn more about our <a href="/how-it-works" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">payment terms and deposit schedule</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Optional Add-Ons</h2>
      <p>Not everyone will want (or can afford) every activity. Make some things optional. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Core package: <a href="/properties" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">accommodation</a>, Saturday dinner, one activity</li>
        <li>Optional extras: <a href="/spa-treatments" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">spa treatments</a>, additional <a href="/experiences" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">experiences</a>, upgraded rooms</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Organiser's Expenses</h2>
      <p>If you're doing the organising, it's fair to have your expenses covered (taxi to collect supplies, printing costs, etc.). Just be upfront about this.</p>
      
      <h2>What If Someone Can't Afford It?</h2>
      <p>This is tricky. Options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjust the overall budget down</li>
        <li>Let them opt out of certain activities without judgement</li>
        <li>If the bride wants that person there regardless, she might choose to subsidise them</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Cancellation Scenario</h2>
      <p>Have a plan for what happens if someone drops out. Most <a href="/booking-terms" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">house bookings</a> have strict cancellation policies, so the group needs to know whether they'll absorb that person's share or if deposits are non-refundable.</p>
      
      <h2>Final Payment Deadline</h2>
      <p>Set a clear deadline for final payments – at least a month before the trip. This gives you time to chase any stragglers without last-minute stress.</p>
      
      <p>The key to avoiding money drama is overcommunication. Send clear breakdowns, set expectations early, and make sure everyone knows what they're signing up for before they commit. For a complete overview of planning timelines and costs, see our <a href="/blog/hen-party-checklist" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hen party planning checklist</a>.

      <h2>Inside the Property</h2>
      <p><strong>Sleeping Arrangements</strong> - Eight bedrooms sleeping up to 16 guests. Mix of doubles, twins, and bunk rooms. Every bedroom has its own character, from the master suite with en-suite bathroom to the cosy attic rooms with sea glimpses.

Bi-fold doors open onto the garden when the weather's nice.</p>
      
      <h2>The Game Changer: Outdoor Hot Tub</h2>
      <p>Positioned in a private corner of the garden, the <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hot tub</a> seats eight comfortably. It's heated, lit with mood lighting, and surrounded by screens for privacy. This is where most groups spend their Friday night, prosecco in hand. See all our <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">houses with hot tubs</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Entertainment Options</h2>
      <p>The basement <a href="/houses-with-games-rooms" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">games room</a> includes a pool table, table football, and a cocktail bar setup. There's also a Smart TV and sound system for karaoke or movie nights. WiFi throughout is fast and reliable. Perfect for booking a <a href="/experiences/cocktail-masterclass" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">cocktail masterclass</a> in-house.</p>
      
      <h2>Little Luxuries</h2>

      </ul>
      
      <h2>Location Benefits</h2>
      <p>The real win is the location. You're close enough to walk into town (or Uber for £5), but the street itself is quiet and residential. Perfect for groups who want to <a href="/house-styles/party-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">party</a> but also need somewhere to recover. Read our full <a href="/blog/brighton-hen-do-guide" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Brighton hen do guide</a> for area tips.</p>
      
      <p>Within walking distance:</p>

        <li>Multiple supermarkets - 5 mins</li>
        <li>Restaurant and cafe strip - 8 mins</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Hen Party Friendly Features</h2>
      <p>The owners genuinely welcome hen parties (not all properties do). They've thought about what groups need: plenty of fridge space, a big dining table for group meals, a sound system that actually works, and enough bathrooms that there's never a queue. Check our <a href="/blog/hen-party-checklist" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">planning checklist</a> for what to look for in a house.</p>
      
      <h2>Booking Details</h2>
      <p><strong>Sleeps:</strong> 16 guests<br>
      <strong>Bedrooms:</strong> 8<br>
      <strong>Bathrooms:</strong> 4<br>
      <strong>Weekend (Fri-Sun):</strong> From £2,400<br>
      <strong>Midweek (Mon-Fri):</strong> From £1,800</p>
      
      <p>When you break down the weekend rate between 15 guests (remember, the bride doesn't pay), it works out to £160 per person for two nights in a gorgeous property. Factor in that you're not paying for hotels, and it's excellent value. See our guide on <a href="/blog/split-costs-hen-weekend" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">how to split costs fairly</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - Sophisticated, cultured, and undeniably pretty. This is the choice for groups who want beautiful surroundings, historic charm, and a more refined pace. Browse our <a href="/destinations/bath" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Bath properties</a>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - Energetic, eclectic, and party-ready. Choose Brighton if your group loves nightlife, wants beach access, and enjoys a more alternative, quirky atmosphere. See our <a href="/destinations/brighton" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Brighton houses</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Accommodation</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - Georgian townhouses with period features. Expect high ceilings, sash windows, and elegant interiors. Properties tend to be in the city or surrounding Cotswold villages. Our <a href="/house-styles/manor-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">manor houses</a> work beautifully here.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - More variety, from Victorian villas to modern apartments. Often come with <a href="/houses-with-hot-tubs" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">hot tubs</a> and <a href="/houses-with-games-rooms" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">games rooms</a>. Easy to find places within walking distance of everything. Browse our <a href="/house-styles/party-houses" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">party houses</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Food Scene</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - Fine dining and afternoon tea reign supreme. The Ivy, The Pump Room, and Sotto Sotto for Italian. Excellent brunch spots in the Lanes. Consider booking a <a href="/experiences/private-chef" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">private chef</a> for a special meal.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - More casual and diverse. Brilliant vegetarian scene, fantastic brunches, street food markets, and everything from fish and chips to Michelin-starred restaurants.</p>
      
      <h2>Activities</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thermae Bath Spa (the rooftop pool is Instagram gold) - perfect for <a href="/spa-treatments" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">spa treatments</a></li>
        <li>Roman Baths tour</li>
        <li>Afternoon tea experiences</li>

        <li>Countryside walks in the Cotswolds</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      
      <h2>Nightlife</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - More limited but improving. Good cocktail bars and a few late-night venues. Most groups do dinner and drinks rather than clubbing. Expect things to wind down by 2am.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - Legendary. Bars, clubs, and live music venues everywhere. You can party until 6am if that's your thing. Much better for groups who want a proper night out.</p>
      
      <h2>Getting There</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - 1.5 hours from London by train. Driving can be tricky, and parking is expensive. Most groups get the train and use taxis or walk around the compact city centre.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - 1 hour from London, excellent train connections. Easier to drive to with better parking options. More accessible from various parts of the UK.</p>
      
      <h2>Weather Considerations</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - All-weather destination. Most activities work rain or shine, and the city is beautiful in any season.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - Better in good weather when you can enjoy the beach and seafront. Still fun in winter but the experience is different.</p>
      
      <h2>Budget</h2>
      <p><strong>Bath</strong> - Generally more expensive. Accommodation, restaurants, and activities tend to cost more. Budget £300-400 per person for a weekend. Read our guide on <a href="/blog/split-costs-hen-weekend" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">splitting costs fairly</a>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Brighton</strong> - More options across price ranges. Easier to do Brighton on a budget if needed. Expect £250-350 per person.</p>
      
      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p><strong>Choose Bath if:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your group prefers elegant and sophisticated</li>
        <li><a href="/spa-treatments" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">Spa experiences</a> appeal more than nightclubs</li>
        <li>You want beautiful, Instagrammable surroundings</li>
        <li>The bride isn't into big party vibes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Choose Brighton if:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nightlife is a priority</li>
        <li>Your group loves the beach</li>
        <li>You want more variety in <a href="/blog/alternative-hen-party-ideas" style="color: var(--color-accent-sage); text-decoration: underline;">activities</a> and food</li>
        <li>Budget is a concern</li>
        <li>Accessibility matters (it's easier to get to)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Honestly, both cities are brilliant for hen parties. The "right" choice depends entirely on your group's personality and what kind of weekend you want. Can't decide?
